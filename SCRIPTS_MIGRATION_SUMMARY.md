# Scripts Directory Migration and Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup and reorganization of the `scripts/` directory, including the removal of outdated migration scripts and the addition of a new migration for the trouble reports markdown feature.

## Changes Made

### ✅ Scripts Removed

The following outdated scripts have been removed as they are no longer needed:

#### `migrate-add-identifier.sh` (REMOVED)

- **Reason**: Superseded by the notes system refactor migration
- **Original Purpose**: Added `identifier` column to `metal_sheets` table for SACMI/SITI distinction
- **Status**: Functionality incorporated into main application logic, migration no longer needed

#### `test-migration.sh` (REMOVED)

- **Reason**: Testing script for old migration system
- **Original Purpose**: Test harness for migration validation
- **Status**: No longer relevant with current migration approach

#### `fix-null-linked-values.sh` (REMOVED)

- **Reason**: Related to old notes linking system that has been refactored
- **Original Purpose**: Fixed NULL values in old notes linking format
- **Status**: Issue resolved by notes system refactor migration

#### `fix-null-linked-values.sql` (REMOVED)

- **Reason**: SQL companion to the above script
- **Status**: No longer needed after notes system migration

#### `cleanup-old-migrations.sh` (REMOVED)

- **Reason**: No longer needed after manual cleanup
- **Original Purpose**: Automated removal of deprecated migration scripts
- **Status**: Task completed, script no longer needed

#### `test-caching.sh` (REMOVED)

- **Reason**: Testing script not related to migrations
- **Original Purpose**: Cache testing functionality
- **Status**: Not relevant to current migration system

### ✅ Scripts Added

#### `migrate-trouble-reports-markdown.sh` (NEW)

- **Purpose**: Adds markdown support to trouble reports feature
- **Functionality**:
  - Adds `use_markdown BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0` column to `trouble_reports` table
  - Sets all existing records to `use_markdown = 0` for backward compatibility
  - Creates automatic database backup before migration
  - Validates migration success with comprehensive checks
  - Supports dry-run mode and help documentation

### ✅ Scripts Updated

#### `migrate-notes-system-refactor.sh` (UPDATED)

- **Changes**: Removed references to deleted migration scripts
- **Status**: Remains as the primary notes system migration

#### `MIGRATION-README.md` (COMPLETELY REWRITTEN)

- **Changes**:
  - Removed documentation for deleted scripts
  - Added comprehensive documentation for new markdown migration
  - Updated general migration guidelines
  - Improved backup and rollback procedures
  - Added migration order recommendations

## Current Scripts Directory Structure

```
scripts/
├── backups/                                    # Auto-created backup directory
├── .gitignore                                  # Git ignore rules for backups
├── MIGRATION-README.md                         # Complete migration documentation
├── migrate-notes-system-refactor.sh           # Notes system migration
└── migrate-trouble-reports-markdown.sh        # NEW: Markdown support migration
```

## Migration Script Features

### Standard Features (All Migration Scripts)

- **Automatic Backups**: Database backed up before any changes
- **Validation**: Success verified before completion
- **Error Handling**: Scripts stop on first error to prevent corruption
- **Dry-run Mode**: Preview changes without applying them
- **Help Documentation**: `--help` flag provides detailed usage information
- **Color-coded Output**: Visual feedback for different message types
- **Safety Checks**: Prerequisites validated before execution

### New Markdown Migration Specific Features

- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing reports continue as plain text
- **Default Values**: New column defaults to `false` (plain text mode)
- **Schema Validation**: Comprehensive verification of database structure
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures no NULL values in new column
- **Migration Detection**: Automatically detects if migration already applied

## Migration Order and Dependencies

### Current Recommended Order

1. **`migrate-notes-system-refactor.sh`** - If upgrading from old notes system
2. **`migrate-trouble-reports-markdown.sh`** - For markdown support in trouble reports

### No Dependencies

- Each migration is independent and can be run separately
- Migration scripts detect existing state and adapt accordingly
- Safe to re-run migrations (idempotent where possible)

## Usage Instructions

### For System Administrators

1. **Before Migration**:

   ```bash
   # Stop the pg-press application
   sudo systemctl stop pg-press  # or equivalent
   ```

2. **Run Migration**:

   ```bash
   # From project root directory
   ./scripts/migrate-trouble-reports-markdown.sh

   # For preview without changes
   ./scripts/migrate-trouble-reports-markdown.sh --dry-run
   ```

3. **After Migration**:
   ```bash
   # Restart the pg-press application
   sudo systemctl start pg-press  # or equivalent
   ```

### For Developers

```bash
# Check what would be changed
./scripts/migrate-trouble-reports-markdown.sh --dry-run

# Run migration with backup
./scripts/migrate-trouble-reports-markdown.sh

# Check migration status
sqlite3 pg-press.db "PRAGMA table_info(trouble_reports);"
```

## Backup and Recovery

### Automatic Backups

- All migrations create timestamped backups in `scripts/backups/`
- Backup format: `pg-press_before_migration_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db`
- Backups preserved indefinitely (manual cleanup recommended)

### Recovery Procedure

```bash
# Stop application
sudo systemctl stop pg-press

# Restore from backup
cp scripts/backups/pg-press_before_markdown_migration_20240101_120000.db pg-press.db

# Restart application
sudo systemctl start pg-press
```

## Benefits of Cleanup

## New Markdown Feature Integration

### Database Changes

```sql
-- Added to trouble_reports table
ALTER TABLE trouble_reports ADD COLUMN use_markdown BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0;
```

### Application Features Enabled

- **Opt-in Markdown**: Users can enable markdown formatting per report
- **Rich Text Display**: Markdown renders as HTML in web interface
- **PDF Integration**: Markdown content formats properly in PDF exports
- **Security**: Built-in XSS prevention and HTML sanitization
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing reports unaffected

### User Interface Enhancements

- Professional CSS styling for rendered content

## Testing Recommendations

### Pre-deployment Testing

```bash
# Test dry-run functionality
./scripts/migrate-trouble-reports-markdown.sh --dry-run

# Test help documentation
./scripts/migrate-trouble-reports-markdown.sh --help

# Verify backup creation works
ls -la scripts/backups/
```

### Post-deployment Verification

```bash
# Verify table structure
sqlite3 pg-press.db "PRAGMA table_info(trouble_reports);"

# Check data integrity
sqlite3 pg-press.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trouble_reports WHERE use_markdown IS NULL;"

# Verify application functionality
# - Create new trouble report with markdown enabled
# - Edit existing trouble report (should remain plain text)
# - Generate PDF of markdown report
# - Test XSS prevention with malicious input
```

## Future Migration Guidelines

### When Adding New Migrations

1. **Follow Naming Convention**: `migrate-feature-description.sh`
2. **Include Standard Features**: Backup, validation, dry-run, help
3. **Update Documentation**: Add to MIGRATION-README.md
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify on copy of production data
5. **Make Executable**: `chmod +x script-name.sh`

### Migration Script Template

Use `migrate-trouble-reports-markdown.sh` as reference for:

- Error handling patterns
- Backup creation
- Validation procedures
- Help documentation
- Color-coded output

## Conclusion

The scripts directory cleanup and new markdown migration represent a significant improvement in:

- **Code Quality**: Removed technical debt and outdated scripts
- **User Experience**: Clear migration path with comprehensive documentation
- **Maintainability**: Consistent patterns and thorough error handling
- **Safety**: Automatic backups and validation procedures
- **Feature Delivery**: Seamless integration of markdown support

The migration system is now streamlined, well-documented, and ready for future enhancements while maintaining full backward compatibility and data safety.
