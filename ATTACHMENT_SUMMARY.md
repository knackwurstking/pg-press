## Technical Specifications

### File Limits

- **Maximum file size**: 10MB per attachment
- **Maximum attachments**: 10 per trouble report
- **Total storage**: Limited by database BLOB field capacity

### Supported File Types

#### Images

- JPEG/JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP, BMP

#### Documents

- PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF, ODT

#### Archives

- ZIP, RAR, 7Z, TAR, GZ, BZ2

### Security Features

- Multi-layer MIME type validation
- File size enforcement (client and server)
- Content-based type detection
- Filename sanitization
- Secure binary storage in database

## Key Implementation Details

### Unique ID Generation

```go
attachmentID := fmt.Sprintf("%s_%s_%d", sanitizedFilename, timestamp, index)
```

### MIME Type Detection

1. HTTP header Content-Type
2. Go's `http.DetectContentType()`
3. File extension fallback mapping

### Database Storage

- Files stored as binary data in existing `linked_attachments` BLOB field
- JSON serialization of attachment metadata
- No database schema changes required

### Frontend Features

- Drag-and-drop upload with visual feedback
- Real-time file validation and preview
- Sortable existing attachments using SortableJS
- Responsive design with Bootstrap icons
- Progressive enhancement with JavaScript

## Usage Examples

### Creating Report with Attachments

1. Open trouble report dialog
2. Fill title and content
3. Drag files to upload area or click to select
4. Review file preview and validation
5. Submit form

### Managing Existing Attachments

1. Open existing report for editing
2. View current attachments with file type icons
3. Drag to reorder using grip handles
4. Click "View" to download or "Delete" to remove
5. Add new files if needed
6. Submit to save changes

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage

- Attachment validation (size, type, content)
- File upload processing
- MIME type detection accuracy
- Trouble report integration
- Utility method functionality
- Performance benchmarks

### Manual Testing Scenarios

- Upload various file types and sizes
- Test drag-and-drop across browsers
- Validate file size and count limits
- Test attachment reordering
- Verify download/view functionality
- Test deletion and persistence

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented

- Efficient MIME type detection with fallbacks
- Unique ID generation using timestamps
- Client-side validation to reduce server load
- Progressive file loading and preview

### Known Limitations

- Files stored in database (consider file system for large deployments)
- No automatic image compression
- No virus scanning integration
- Memory usage for large file processing

## Deployment Requirements

### Dependencies

- **SortableJS**: CDN loaded for drag-and-drop functionality
- **Bootstrap Icons**: Required for file type and action icons
- **Modern Browser**: File API support required

### Configuration

- Attachment limits configurable via constants
- MIME type mappings can be extended
- Error messages are customizable

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Potential Improvements

1. **File System Storage**: Move from database to file system with references
2. **Image Processing**: Automatic thumbnail generation and compression
3. **Cloud Storage**: Integration with AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage
4. **Virus Scanning**: Integrate with antivirus services
5. **Preview Generation**: PDF and document preview capabilities
6. **Compression**: Automatic file compression for supported formats
7. **Progress Tracking**: Upload progress indicators
8. **Batch Operations**: Bulk attachment management

### Scalability Considerations

- Monitor database size growth from attachments
- Consider archiving old reports with large attachments
- Implement file cleanup procedures for deleted reports
- Add monitoring for attachment storage usage

## Validation Results
