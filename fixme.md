- [x] After tool edit (put) the page does not reload (tool page) - ex.: page title not changing
- [x] Partial cycles seams to be messed up (not working at all, always zero)
- [x] `failed to update note: database update failed: %!w(<nil>)` after try to change a notes content
- [x] `failed to delete note: database delete failed: %!w(<nil>)` after try to delete a note
- [x] `failed to update press cycle: database update failed: %!w(<nil>)` after edit an existing cycle via the tool page
- [x] Partial Cycles in the pdf summary is still zero
- [ ] Fix the "Ooops, There Is No Binding Tool" message on the press page
- [ ] If submitting and "umbau" i got the error `failed to unassign tool 1: validation error: invalid press number: 0`, the tool stays the same, but the cycles entry has a new entry
- [ ] Feeds counter seems to be missig
