## üîÑ Verification Steps

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **Backup Database**: Create full backup before deploying
- [ ] **Test Migration**: Run migration on copy of production data
- [ ] **Verify Data Integrity**: Ensure all existing attachments migrate correctly
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Test with production-sized datasets

### Code Quality Checks

- [x] **Go Build**: All packages compile successfully
- [x] **Static Analysis**: No linting errors
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Run existing test suite
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Test end-to-end functionality

### Migration Verification

- [ ] **Column Type Check**: Verify `linked_attachments` is TEXT
- [ ] **Data Migration Check**: Verify attachments moved to separate table
- [ ] **Reference Integrity**: Verify attachment IDs match in both tables
- [ ] **Orphan Cleanup**: Verify no orphaned attachments exist

### Functionality Testing

- [ ] **Upload New Attachments**: Test file upload in trouble report creation
- [ ] **View Attachments**: Test attachment viewing/downloading
- [ ] **Edit Attachments**: Test attachment reordering and deletion
- [ ] **Lazy Loading**: Verify attachments load only when needed
- [ ] **Performance**: Verify improved listing performance

## üö® Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Immediate Checks (First Hour)

- [ ] **Application Startup**: Verify app starts without errors
- [ ] **Migration Logs**: Check migration completed successfully
- [ ] **Basic Functionality**: Test creating/viewing trouble reports
- [ ] **Error Logs**: Monitor for new errors

### Short-term Monitoring (First Day)

- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Monitor response times
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Verify reduced memory consumption
- [ ] **Database Performance**: Monitor query performance
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Check for reported issues

### Long-term Monitoring (First Week)

- [ ] **Database Growth**: Monitor attachments table size
- [ ] **Orphaned Attachments**: Run cleanup and monitor counts
- [ ] **Performance Trends**: Track performance improvements
- [ ] **Error Patterns**: Look for recurring issues

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues & Solutions

### Migration Issues

- **Issue**: Large database takes too long to migrate
    - **Solution**: Consider batched migration for very large datasets
    - **Prevention**: Test migration time on production copy

- **Issue**: Disk space insufficient for migration
    - **Solution**: Ensure 2x current database size available
    - **Prevention**: Check disk space before migration

### Runtime Issues

- **Issue**: Attachment not found errors
    - **Solution**: Run orphaned attachment cleanup
    - **Prevention**: Verify migration completed correctly

- **Issue**: Performance degradation
    - **Solution**: Check database indexes, consider query optimization
    - **Prevention**: Monitor database performance metrics

### Data Integrity Issues

- **Issue**: Attachments missing after migration
    - **Solution**: Restore from backup and re-run migration
    - **Prevention**: Verify migration with test data first

## üîß Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Tasks

- [ ] **Orphaned Cleanup**: Run weekly orphaned attachment cleanup
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor response times and memory usage
- [ ] **Database Maintenance**: Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE operations

### Periodic Tasks

- [ ] **Storage Review**: Monthly review of attachment storage usage
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Quarterly review of query performance
- [ ] **Backup Verification**: Regular backup and restore testing

## üìã Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Optional)

- [ ] **Thumbnail Generation**: Generate thumbnails for image attachments
- [ ] **Deduplication**: Implement attachment deduplication
- [ ] **Compression**: Add attachment compression for storage efficiency
- [ ] **CDN Integration**: Move attachments to cloud storage/CDN

### Phase 3 (Advanced)

- [ ] **Full-text Search**: Index attachment content for search
- [ ] **Versioning**: Implement attachment versioning
- [ ] **Caching Layer**: Add Redis/Memcached for frequently accessed attachments
- [ ] **Streaming**: Implement streaming for large file downloads
