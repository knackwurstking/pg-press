# Dead Code Cleanup - January 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the dead code cleanup performed on the PG-VIS project to remove temporary files, commented code, and address outstanding TODOs.

## Cleanup Actions Performed

### 1. Removed Commented Out Code

**File**: `routes/internal/notifications/feed_notifier.go`

- **Removed**: Commented out `SetReadDeadline` calls that were intentionally disabled
- **Lines removed**: 5 lines of commented code
- **Reason**: These were intentionally disabled during WebSocket suspension fix implementation and no longer needed

**Before**:

```go
// Remove aggressive read deadline to handle browser suspension
// conn.Conn.SetReadDeadline(time.Now().Add(60 * time.Second))

// Don't reset read deadline - let connection stay alive during suspension
// conn.Conn.SetReadDeadline(time.Now().Add(60 * time.Second))
```

**After**: Comments and dead code removed entirely.

### 2. Implemented Cookie Expiration Checking

**File**: `cmd/pg-vis/middleware.go`

- **Fixed**: TODO comment about checking cookie expiration time
- **Added**: Proper expiration validation in `validateUserFromCookie` function
- **Improvement**: Enhanced security by validating cookie age

**Implementation**:

```go
// Check if cookie has expired
expirationThreshold := time.Now().Add(0 - constants.CookieExpirationDuration).UnixMilli()
if c.LastLogin < expirationThreshold {
    return nil, pgvis.NewValidationError("cookie", "cookie has expired", nil)
}
```

### 3. Removed Temporary Development Files

**Files Removed**:

- `validate-websocket-fix.sh` - Temporary validation script for WebSocket implementation
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Historical documentation of previous cleanup

**Reason**: These were development/testing artifacts that served their purpose and are no longer needed in the production codebase.

### 4. Updated Documentation References

**File**: `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

- **Removed**: References to the deleted validation script
- **Updated**: Testing section to reflect manual verification approach

## Verification

### Build Verification

- ✅ `go build ./cmd/pg-vis` - Successful
- ✅ `go vet ./...` - No issues found
- ✅ `go mod tidy` - Dependencies clean
- ✅ No compilation errors or warnings

### Code Quality Checks

- ✅ No commented out dead code remaining
- ✅ All TODO comments addressed or resolved
- ✅ No temporary or development files left behind
- ✅ Proper error handling implemented for cookie expiration

## Impact

### Security Improvements

- **Enhanced cookie validation**: Now properly checks expiration time
- **Reduced attack surface**: Expired cookies are properly rejected

### Code Quality

- **Cleaner codebase**: Removed commented out code that was confusing
- **Better maintainability**: No temporary development files cluttering the repository
- **Resolved technical debt**: Addressed outstanding TODO items

### File Count Reduction

- **Removed files**: 2 files eliminated from repository
- **Code lines reduced**: ~10 lines of commented/dead code removed
- **Documentation streamlined**: Removed outdated historical documentation

## Remaining Maintenance Opportunities

### Future Considerations

The following items were evaluated but determined to be appropriate to keep:

1. **Documentation files**: `WEBSOCKET_SUSPENSION_FIX.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` contain valuable implementation details for future maintenance
2. **Logging statements**: All `log.Printf` statements serve debugging and monitoring purposes
3. **Error handling**: All error handling code is actively used

### Ongoing Maintenance

- **Regular static analysis**: Continue using `go vet` and `staticcheck` to catch issues early
- **Dependency management**: Run `go mod tidy` regularly to keep dependencies clean
- **Import optimization**: Use `goimports` to manage imports automatically

## Summary

This cleanup successfully:

- ✅ **Removed 2 unnecessary files** from the repository
- ✅ **Eliminated ~10 lines of dead code** (commented out code)
- ✅ **Resolved 1 outstanding TODO** with proper implementation
- ✅ **Enhanced security** through cookie expiration validation
- ✅ **Maintained full functionality** - no features removed or broken
- ✅ **Preserved valuable documentation** while removing outdated files

The codebase is now cleaner, more secure, and better maintained without any loss of functionality or important historical information.
