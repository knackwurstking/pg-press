## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25 or higher
- Make (for build automation)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/knackwurstking/pg-press.git
   cd pg-press
   ```

2. **Build the application**

   ```bash
   make build
   ```

3. **Create your first user**

   ```bash
   ./bin/pg-press user add 123456789 "Your Name" "your-api-key-here"
   ```

   Note: Replace `123456789` with your Telegram ID, `"Your Name"` with your actual name, and `"your-api-key-here"` with a secure API key.

4. **Start the server**

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

### Development Setup

For development with hot reloading:

```bash
make dev
```

This will start the server with automatic rebuilding on file changes.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable             | Description               | Default        | Example          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| `SERVER_ADDR`        | Server bind address       | `:8080`        | `localhost:3000` |
| `SERVER_PATH_PREFIX` | URL path prefix           | `/`            | `/pg-press`      |
| `DATABASE_PATH`      | SQLite database file      | `pg-press.db`  | `/data/app.db`   |
| `ASSET_VERSION`      | Asset versioning override | auto-generated | `v1.2.3`         |

### Production Deployment

1. **Build production binary**

   ```bash
   make build-prod
   ```

2. **Set production environment**

   ```bash
   export SERVER_ADDR=":8080"
   export SERVER_PATH_PREFIX="/pg-press"
   ```

3. **Run with systemd or supervisor**
   ```bash
   ./bin/pg-press server
   ```

## API Documentation

### Web Interface

PG Press uses an HTMX-based web interface that provides dynamic interactions without traditional REST APIs:

#### Main Pages

- `/` - Dashboard with system overview
- `/tools` - Tools management and press overview
- `/tools/tool/{id}` - Individual tool details
- `/tools/press/{number}` - Press-specific view
- `/trouble-reports` - Trouble reports management
- `/notes` - Notes and documentation system
- `/profile` - User profile and session management

#### Dynamic Features

- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-powered live data updates
- **Partial Page Updates**: HTMX endpoints for seamless interactions
- **Form Handling**: Server-rendered forms with validation
- **File Uploads**: Drag-and-drop attachment support

For complete endpoint documentation, see [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with a comprehensive schema supporting:

- **Users & Authentication**: Secure user management with API keys
- **Tools & Equipment**: Complete tool lifecycle tracking
- **Press Operations**: Multi-press cycle management
- **Documentation**: Notes, reports, and attachments
- **Audit Trail**: Complete modification history

See [docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md) for detailed schema information.
