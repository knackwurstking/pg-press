# Migration System Changes

## ⚠️ Important Notice

The built-in `pgpress migration` commands have been **removed** and replaced with a simplified, more powerful standalone migration tool.

## 🔄 What Changed

### Before (Removed)

```bash
pgpress migration status
pgpress migration run
pgpress migration verify
pgpress migration cleanup
```

### Now (Use Instead)

```bash
go run scripts/migrate_mods.go -action status
go run scripts/migrate_mods.go  # Complete migration (default)
go run scripts/migrate_mods.go -action verify
go run scripts/migrate_mods.go -action cleanup
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Most users should simply run:**

```bash
cd scripts/
go run migrate_mods.go
```

That's it! The tool automatically handles:

- ✅ Database backup
- ✅ Schema setup
- ✅ Data migration
- ✅ Verification
- ✅ Progress reporting

## ✨ New Features

The standalone migration tool provides significant improvements:

- **🛡️ Automatic backups** before any changes
- **👀 Dry-run mode** to preview changes safely
- **🎨 Colorized output** for better readability
- **📊 Enhanced status reporting** with detailed information
- **⚡ Better performance** with optimized queries
- **🔧 No dependencies** on pgpress binary

## 📖 Usage Examples

```bash
# Complete migration with default database
go run migrate_mods.go

# Custom database path
go run migrate_mods.go -db /path/to/data.db

# Dry run to preview changes
go run migrate_mods.go -dry-run

# Check migration status
go run migrate_mods.go -action status -v

# Step-by-step migration
go run migrate_mods.go -action setup    # Setup schema
go run migrate_mods.go -action migrate  # Migrate data
go run migrate_mods.go -action verify   # Verify migration
go run migrate_mods.go -action cleanup  # Remove old columns (optional)
```

## 🔧 Using the Makefile

For convenience, use the included Makefile:

```bash
cd scripts/

# Quick migration
make full

# Custom database
make full DB_PATH=/path/to/data.db

# Other useful commands
make status     # Check status
make dry-run    # Preview migration
make verify     # Verify migration
make help       # Show all options
```
