- [x] Replace the `datalist` input elements with `select` elements for the "umbau" page.
- [x] Also add some input handling for the "umbau" page select elements, which will disable tools not possible to change. For example, if the top tool is from a 100x100 format, the bottom tool must also be from a 100x100 format.

- [ ] Improve model types for ID's [WIP]
  - Attachment IDs
  - Cycle IDs
  - Feed IDs
  - Metal Sheet IDs
  - Modification IDs
  - Note IDs

- [ ] Try to keep the details open state while refreshing somehow.
- [ ] When the filter input is in focus, try to use `scrollIntoView` on each input change.
- [ ] Improve the notes flex grid, (grow, shrink settings)
- [ ] Create helpers for resolved data types (tool, regeneration, ...)
