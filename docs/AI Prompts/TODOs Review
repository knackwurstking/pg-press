I've reviewed the `TODO` comments in your project. Here's a summary and my thoughts on them:

### Summary of TODOs:

*   **`internal/database/core/database.go`**:
    *   `// TODO: Still need to make this services fit the 'interfaces.DataOperations' interface`
    *   `// TODO: Merge helper with services like the PressCycles service`
*   **`internal/database/models/metal-sheets.go`**:
    *   `// TODO: Add a 'MetalSheetList' type with sorting functionality`
*   **`internal/database/models/press-cycles.go`**:
    *   `// TODO: Need to create a new ID type sometime`
*   **`internal/database/models/tools.go`**:
    *   `// TODO: Max cycles: 800.000 (Orange) -> 1.000.000 (Red)`
*   **`internal/database/services/cookie/service.go`**:
    *   `// TODO: Need to fix this type to fit the 'interfaces.DataOperations[*models.Cookie]' type`
*   **`internal/database/services/feed/service.go`**:
    *   `// TODO: Need to fix this type to fit the 'interfaces.DataOperations[*models.Cookie]' type`
*   **`internal/database/services/presscycle/service.go`**:
    *   `// TODO: Create Delete type`
*   **`internal/database/services/regeneration/service.go`**:
    *   `// TODO: Make it fit` (referring to `interfaces.DataOperations`)
*   **`internal/web/htmx/cycles.go`**:
    *   `// TODO: Need to handle regenerations here`
    *   `// TODO: Need to handle regenerations somehow`
*   **`internal/web/htmx/metal-sheets.go`**:
    *   `// TODO: Open edit dialog for adding or editing a metal sheet entry`
*   **`internal/web/templates/components/tools/list.templ`**:
    *   `// TODO: Add icons previewing notes (warning, error, info or whatever)`
*   **`internal/web/templates/pages/tools/press/page.templ`**:
    *   `// TODO: ...` (multiple items related to displaying tool details)
*   **`internal/web/templates/components/troublereports/list.templ`**:
    *   `// TODO: Benutzer ist kein Administrator, Abstimmungssystem zum Löschen von Problemberichten hinzufügen, noch nicht implementiert` (Add voting system for non-admins to delete trouble reports)
*   **`internal/web/templates/components/troublereports/edit-dialog.templ`**:
    *   `// TODO: Do somehtings like the 'get*FormData' method in "tools.go"`

### My Thoughts:

Overall, these `TODO` comments highlight a few key areas for improvement:

1.  **Interface Compliance:** Several `TODOs` mention making services conform to the `interfaces.DataOperations` interface. This is a high-priority task for code consistency and maintainability. It will make your data access layer more predictable and easier to work with.

2.  **Feature Completeness:** There are several `TODOs` for features that are not yet fully implemented, such as the metal sheet editing dialog, handling tool regenerations in the UI, and the voting system for deleting trouble reports. These are important for delivering a complete user experience.

3.  **Refactoring and Code Structure:** The comments about merging helper services and creating a new ID type point to some potential refactoring opportunities to improve the overall structure and reduce redundancy.

4.  **UI/UX Enhancements:** The `TODO` in `list.templ` to add icons for notes is a great example of a small change that can significantly improve the user experience by making important information more visible at a glance.

My recommendation would be to prioritize the interface compliance and refactoring tasks first, as this will create a more stable foundation for completing the remaining features.

I can help you with any of these tasks. Just let me know where you'd like to start
