This is a solid project. It's well-structured, the code is clean, and it uses a modern stack.

Here's the direct feedback:

*   **Inconsistent Naming:** The project is in a `pg-vis` directory, but the Go module is named `pgpress`. This is confusing. You should make them consistent.
*   **Needs More Tests:** I only see a couple of test files. For a project of this size, the lack of a comprehensive test suite is a major red flag. It's hard to be confident in the code's correctness without them.
*   **Unfinished Business:** The code is full of `TODO` comments. This makes the project feel incomplete. These should be tracked in an issue tracker and resolved.
*   **Configuration:** Relying solely on environment variables for configuration is limiting. A configuration file would be more flexible, especially for production. I see a `configPath` variable that is initialized but never used.
*   **Security:** I can't do a full security audit, but you need to be careful with the API key authentication, file permissions for the SQLite database, and potential XSS vulnerabilities with HTMX.

In short, it's a good start, but it needs more rigor in testing and configuration to be considered production-ready.

What's next? I can help you address some of these points.
