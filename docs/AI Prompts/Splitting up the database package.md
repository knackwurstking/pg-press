Yes, that's an excellent observation. The `database` package is quite large, and splitting it would significantly improve the project's structure and maintainability. Your suggestion to create a package for types is a great starting point and a very common practice in Go projects.

Here is my recommendation based on your idea:

### Recommendation: Create a dedicated `models` package

I suggest creating a new package, for example, `internal/models`, to hold all your data structure definitions.

**How to do it:**

1.  **Create a new directory:** `/Users/knackwurstking/Git/pg-vis/internal/models`
2.  **Move the type files:** Move all the `*.types.go` files from `internal/database` into the new `internal/models` directory. You could also rename them to be more concise (e.g., `attachments.types.go` -> `attachments.go`).
3.  **Update package declarations:** In each of the moved files, change the package declaration from `package database` to `package models`.
4.  **Update imports:** In the `internal/database` package (and any other package that uses these types), you would add an import for the new `models` package:
    ```go
    import "github.com/knackwurstking/pgpress/internal/database/models"
    ```
    You would then reference the types with the package name, for example `models.User`, `models.Tool`, etc.

**Benefits of this approach:**

- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Your data models (the "what") are cleanly separated from your database logic (the "how").
- **Reduced Package Size:** The `database` package becomes smaller and more focused on its core responsibility: interacting with the database.
- **Improved Readability and Maintainability:** It's easier for developers to find the code they are looking for.

### Alternative for the Future: Package by Domain

As your application grows even larger, you might consider a "package by domain" or "package by feature" structure. In this approach, you could create sub-packages within `database` (or at the `internal` level) for each major feature, like `user`, `tool`, `report`, etc. Each of these packages would contain its own models, handlers, and helpers.

For now, creating a `models` package is a fantastic step forward and will make your codebase much cleaner.
