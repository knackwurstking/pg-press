Have a look at the internal directory, what do you thing can be improved for a better project structure [@internal](file:///Users/knackwurstking/Git/pg-vis/internal/)

## Assistant

Of course! I'd be happy to take a look at your project structure and offer some suggestions.

First off, I want to say that the current structure of your `internal` directory is already quite well-organized. You've done a great job separating concerns into `database`, `web`, `logger`, `pdf`, and other packages, which is a solid foundation.

However, to enhance clarity and maintainability further, I have a few recommendations. My main suggestions are centered around increasing **cohesion**, which means keeping related code together.

Here are my thoughts:

### 1. Refactor the `constants` Package

The `internal/constants` package currently holds constants for many different parts of your application. While this works, it can sometimes become a "catch-all" package that is loosely connected to many other parts of your application. A common best practice is to define constants as close as possible to where they are used.

**My suggestions are:**

*   **Web-related constants**: The constants defined in `cookie.go`, `form.go`, `html.go`, and `query.go` are primarily used within your web layer (handlers and templates). I would recommend moving these into a new package, for example, `internal/web/constants`. The HTML IDs in `html.go`, for instance, are very tightly coupled to your templates.
*   **Model validation constants**: The validation rules in `validation.go` (like `UserNameMinLength`) are directly tied to your data models. These would be a perfect fit inside the `internal/database/models` package, right alongside the model definitions they apply to.
*   **Domain-specific constants**: Other constants, like `MaxFeedsPerPage` from `feed.go`, could be moved into their respective service packages (e.g., `internal/database/services/feed`).

By making these changes, your code will be easier to navigate and understand because related logic and configurations will be grouped together.

### 2. Relocate the top-level `utils` Package

The `internal/utils` package contains helpers that appear to be specific to the web layer, such as your Echo router helpers and context utility functions. Their current location at the top of the `internal` directory doesn't immediately signal their purpose.

**My suggestion is:**

*   Move the contents of `internal/utils` into a new package at `internal/web/utils` (or a similar name like `webhelpers`). This would make it much clearer that these utilities are designed for use within the `web` package.

### 3. The `database` Package Structure

Your `database` package is already very well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns into `core`, `errors`, `interfaces`, `models`, and `services`. This is an excellent pattern. The use of `helper.go` files within some of your services to separate core data operations from more complex, specific queries is also a great practice.

As your application continues to grow, you might eventually consider splitting the `models` directory into sub-packages by domain if it becomes very large, but for its current size, it's perfectly organized.

### Summary

The main idea behind these suggestions is to group your code by its domain or feature (cohesion) rather than just by its type (e.g., putting all constants in one place). This approach generally leads to a more maintainable and scalable project structure in the long run.

Overall, you have a solid foundation here! These are just a few refinements that I believe could make your project even better.
