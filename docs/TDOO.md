## Implement Service Helpers

> These are functions, or methods(?), for special tasks where the CRUD operations are too complex or not efficient enough.

For example:

The tool model has no direct information about the active state, if the tool is currently in use or not (press number).
We can implement a helper function that checks if a tool is currently assigned to any press.
