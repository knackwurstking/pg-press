# Help System Documentation Migration Summary

## 🎯 Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive reorganization and migration of all help system documentation into the centralized `docs/` directory structure, completed as part of the interactive markdown help system implementation.

## 📁 Files Moved

### Help System Documentation

| Original Location           | New Location                    | Description                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `HELP_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md`   | `docs/HELP_SYSTEM.md`           | Comprehensive help system implementation guide |
| `MARKDOWN_IMPROVEMENTS.md`  | `docs/MARKDOWN_ENHANCEMENTS.md` | Recent markdown improvements and new features  |
